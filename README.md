# React FreeCodeCamp

My version of FreeCodeCamp project exercise:

>*Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.
>Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.*

## testing

- You can test the project cloning the repo with: `git clone`
- Open the cloned folder and install dependencies typing `npm install`
- Now you can run `npm run dev` and test the exercise
